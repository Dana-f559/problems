# Perimeter Of A Rectange
## Backgroud
In grade 3, u learn how to calculate the perimeter of a rectange. After this by taking small steps you learn more advanced maths. It is the same with programming, first small steps then you go up higher. This is why this practice probelem is starting with the small step, and making you implement a programm that would calculate a rectangles perimeter. 

## Understanding
Your programm will need to take in two inputs, which would be the two sides of the perimeter (side a, side b). Then with the help of calc_perimeter function you are going to calculate the perimeter, and print it.


## Specification
You will implement two functions main and calc_perimeter. 
    In the main function you will prompt the user for two numbers (side a, and side b), then call the calc_perimeter function, passing in the side a and side b. Then you will print the perimeter. 
    
In the calc_perimeter function you will take in two inputs as the function parameters which would be the two sides of 
a rectangle. Then you will calculate the perimeter, and return the number.

Dont forget that input returns a string, so you will have to convert it to an int https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp

# To start
Create a new folder called perimeter (feel free to copy thin into your terminal)
```
mdkir perimeter
cd perimeter
```
create a new file called perimeter.py
```
code perimeter.py
```
now you can code in the new file created

# Testing your programm 
### 1)
Enter this as the folowing input:
```
Side a: 5
Side b: 2
```
You are supposed to get 14 as the output
```
Perimeter: 14
```

### 2)
Enter this as the folowing input:
```
Side a: 10
Side b: 5
```
You are supposed to get 30 as the output
```
Perimeter: 30
```

### 3)
Enter this as the folowing input:
```
Side a: 2
Side b: 4
```
You are supposed to get 12 as the output
```
Perimeter: 12
```
