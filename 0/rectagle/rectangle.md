# Perimeter 

You will implement two functions main and calc_perimeter. 
    In the calc_perimeter function you will take in two inputs as the function parameters which would be the two sides of 
a rectangle. Then you will calculate the perimeter, and return the number. 
    In the main function you will prompt the user for two numbers (side a, and side b), then call the calc_perimeter function, passing in the side a and side b. Then you will print the perimeter.

    Dont forget that input returns a string, so you will have to convert it to an int https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp
    To define a function which can take in parameters you can check out this link https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp

# To start
Create a new folder called perimeter (feel free to copy thin into your terminal)
```
mdkir perimeter
cd perimeter
```
create a new file called perimeter.py
```
code perimeter.py
```
now you can code in the new file created

# How to test your program
### 1)
Enter this as the folowing input:
```
Side a: 5
Side b: 2
```
You are supposed to get 14 as the output

### 2)
Enter this as the folowing input:
```
Side a: 10
Side b: 5
```
You are supposed to get 30 as the output

### 3)
Enter this as the folowing input:
```
Side a: 2
Side b: 4
```
You are supposed to get 12 as the output
